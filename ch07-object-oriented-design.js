  7.1: DECK OF CARDS

  Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you
  would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.

  Hints: #153, #275

/************************************************************************
  
  7.2: CALL CENTER

  Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees:
  respondent, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must be
  first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't
  handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the
  manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be
  escalated to a director. Design the classes and data structures for
  this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to
  the first available employee.

  Hints: #363

  7.6: JIGSAW

  Implement an NxN jigsaw puzzle. Design the data structures and explain
  an algorithm to solve the puzzle. You can assume that you have a
  fitsWith method which, when passed two puzzle edges, returns true if
  the two edges belong together.

  Hints: #192, #238, #283

  7.7: CHAT SERVER

  Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide
  details about the various backend components, classes, and methods.
  What would be the hardest problems to solve?

  Hints: #213, #245, #271

/************************************************************************
  
  7.8: OTHELLO

  Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side
  and black on the other. When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on
  both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said
  to be captured and its color is flipped. On your turn, you must capture
  at least one of your opponent's pieces. The game ends when either user
  has no more valid moves. The win is assigned to the person with the
  most pieces. Implement the object-oriented design for Othello.

  Hints: #179, #228

************************************************************************/



/************************************************************************
  
  7.9: CIRCULAR ARRAY

  Implement a CircularArray class that supports an array-like data
  structure which can be efficiently rotated. If possible, the class
  should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support
  iteration via the standard f or (Obj o : circ ularArray) notation.

  Hints: #389
  
************************************************************************/



/************************************************************************
  
  7.10: MINESWEEPER

  Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game. Minesweeper is the
  classic single-player computer game where an NxN grid has B mines (or
  bombs) hidden across the grid. The remaining cells are either blank or
  have a number behind them. The numbers reflect the number of bombs in
  the surrounding eight cells. The user then uncovers a cell. If it is a 
  bomb, the player loses. If it is a number, the number is exposed. If
  it is a blank cell, this cell and all adjacent blank cells (up to and
  including the surrounding numeric cells) are exposed. The player wins
  when all non-bomb cells are exposed. The player can also flag certain
  places as potential bombs. This doesn't affect game play, other than
  to block the user from accidentally clicking a cell that is thought to
  have a bomb.
