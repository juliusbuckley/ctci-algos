  9.1: STOCK DATA

  Stock Data: Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be
  called by up to 1,000 client applications to get simple end-of-day
  stock price information (open, close, high, low). You may assume that
  you already have the data, and you can store it in any format you wish.
  How would you design the client-facing service that provides the
  information to client applications?You are responsible for the
  development, rollout, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the
  feed. Describe the different methods you considered and why you would
  recommend your approach. Your service can use any technologies you
  wish, and can distribute the information to the client applications in
  any mechanism you choose.

/************************************************************************
  
  9.2: SOCIAL NETWORK

  How would you design the data structures for a very large social
  network like Facebook or LinkedIn? Describe how you would design an
  algorithm to show the shortest path between two people:
  (e.g., Me -> Bob -> Susan -> Jason -> You).

  9.3: WEB CRAWLER

  If you were designing a web crawler, how would you avoid getting into
  infinite loops?

  Hints: #334, #353, #365

/************************************************************************
  
  9.4: DUPLICATE URLS

  You have 10 billion URLs. How do you detect the duplicate documents?
  In this case, assume "duplicate" means that the URLs are identical.

  Hints: #326, #347

/************************************************************************
  
  9.5: CACHE

  Imagine a web server for a simplified search engine. This system has
  100 machines to respond to search queries, which may then call out
  using proc essSearch ( string query) to another cluster of machines to
  actually get the result. The machine which responds to a given query is
  chosen at random, so you cannot guarantee that the same machine will
  always respond to the same request. The method proc essSearch is very
  expensive. Design a caching mechanism for the most recent queries. Be
  sure to explain how you would update the cache when data changes.

/************************************************************************
  
  9.6: SALES RANK

  A large eCommerce company wishes to list the best-selling products,
  overall and by category. For example, one product might be the #1056th
  best-selling product overall but the #13th best-selling product under
  "Sports Equipment" and the #24th best-selling product under "Safety." 
  Describe how you would design this system.
